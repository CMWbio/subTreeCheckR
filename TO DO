# General Implementations

## R funcitons

- Finish converting scrips to functions
- Add da to its on script that you provide what popX and popY are to the function to control negativity
- Should I add ABBA BABA? 

## Shiny

- Add trees tab
  - include dist.topo
  - will inputing a list into dist.top for a scaffold then give a matrix of each comparison?
    - this can be used for a heatmap across a scaffold
    - would it also be possible to generate a euclidian distance matrix from values of the branch length distance for every window 
    of each comparison? such that the euclidian distance would indicate the difference between individuals across a scaffold?
- add distances tab
  - this should contain da, pi, dxy
